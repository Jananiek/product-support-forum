# Express PG rest API üõ°Ô∏è

This is a rest API repository to ask and answer questions related to a product.

## Development

We use `node` version `14.9.0`

```
nvm install 14.9.0
```

```
nvm use 14.9.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:

## Online one-click setup

You can use Gitpod for the one click online setup. With a single click it will launch a workspace and automatically:

- clone the `product-support-forum` repo.
- install the dependencies.
- run `cp .env.example .env`.
- configure database credentials with yours in ` .env` file
- run `npm run start`.

## Data seed
- run `npm run seed:config` then `npm run seed:run`.
- To drop all tables run `npm run schema:drop`.
- To sync the database run `npm run schema:sync`.


# API Validation

 By using [celebrate](https://github.com/arb/celebrate), the req.body schema becomes cleary defined at route level, so even frontend devs can read what an API endpoint expects without needing to write documentation that can get outdated quickly.

 ```js
 route.post('/signup',
  celebrate({
    body: Joi.object({
      name: Joi.string().required(),
      email: Joi.string().required(),
      password: Joi.string().required(),
    }),
  }),
  controller.signup)
 ```

 **Example error**

 ```json
 {
  "errors": {
    "message": "child \"email\" fails because [\"email\" is required]"
  }
 }
 ```
